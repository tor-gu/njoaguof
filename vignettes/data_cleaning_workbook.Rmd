```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(njoaguof)
```

## Set up

Load the Use of Force raw data.

```{r}
data("use_of_force_raw")
uof_raw <- use_of_force_raw
```

We will also need county and municipality data from the US Census, gathered using the `tidycensus` package:
```{r}
data("census_counties")
data("census_municipalities")
```

Some regular expressions we will use repeatedly

```{r}
trailing_comma_regex <- "(?<=.),?$"
sep_comma_no_space <- ",(?! )"
sep_comma_space_no_paren <- r"( ?,(?![^(]*\)) )"
sep_comma_optional_space <- r"( ?, ?)"
```

## Pre-validation

Before we start parsing, we will verify some things.

### Column names

First, here are the columns we are expecting.

```{r}
raw_names <- c(
  "FormID"                         ,"County",
  "AgencyName"                     ,"OfficerName",
  "UserID"                         ,"IncidentID", 
  "ReportNumber"                   ,"IncidentCaseNumber",
  "IncidentDate"                   ,"OtherOfficerInvolved",
  "OfficerInUniform"               ,"IncidentMunicipality",
  "IndoorOrOutdoor"                ,"IncidentWeather",
  "VideoFootage"                   ,"VideoType",
  "IncidentLighting",
  "LocationType"                   ,"IncidentType",
  "ContactOrigin"                  ,"PlannedContact",
  "OfficerAge"                     ,"OfficerRaceEthnicity",
  "OfficerRank"                    ,"OfficerGender",
  "OfficerInjuryType"              ,"OfficerInjuriesInjured",
  "OfficerMedicalTreatment"        ,"OfficerHospitalTreatment",
  "TotalSubInjuredInIncident"      ,"SubjectInjuredInIncident",
  "SubjectInjuredPriorToIncident"  ,"PerceivedConditionOfSubject",
  "SubjectActions"                 ,"SubjectResistance",
  "SubjectMedicalTreatment"        ,"SubjectInjuryType",
  "SubjectArrested"                ,"ReasonSubjectNotArrested",
  "SubjectType"                    ,"SubjectAge",
  "SubjectRaceEthnicity"           ,"SubjectGender",
  "ForceType",
  "IncidentYear",
  "KEEPDROP"                       ,"staticContent976"
)
stopifnot(all.equal(names(uof_raw), raw_names))
```

### Levels

We will use this function to check the levels of multi-valued fields.

```{r}
check_list_levels <- function(tbl,
                              column,
                              separating_regex,
                              levels,
                              other_acceptable_values = character(0)) {
  message("Checking for unmatched values in ",
          rlang::as_label(rlang::enquo(column)))
  unmatched_values <- tbl %>%
    dplyr::pull({{column}}) %>%
    stringr::str_split(separating_regex) %>%
    unlist() %>% unique() %>%
    setdiff(levels) %>% setdiff(other_acceptable_values)
  if (length(unmatched_values) != 0) {
    message(paste(unmatched_values, collapse = " | "))
    stop()
  }
}
```

county_levels <- census_counties %>% pull(county)
```


Now we will check that the multi-value fields contain only these levels.

```{r}
uof_raw_trimmed <- uof_raw %>%
  dplyr::mutate(across(
  where(is.character),

   sep_comma_optional_space,
   reason_not_arrested_levels,
  c("Not Provided", "", "NoProbableCause-SubjectNotInvolved", "Insufficient Probable Cause-includes continuing investigation")
)

```

Finally, we check the county field.  There are two non-county values which we 
are expecting (and will map to `NA`): `"Other"` and `"NJSP"`.

```{r}
stopifnot(all(
  setdiff(uof_raw %>% dplyr::pull(County) %>% paste0(" County"),
        county_levels) %in%
    c("Other County", "NJSP County")
  )
)
```

## `subject` table

```{r}
subject <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID,
         SubjectArrested,
         SubjectType,
         SubjectAge,
         SubjectRaceEthnicity,
         SubjectGender,
         SubjectInjuredInIncident,
         SubjectInjuredPriorToIncident) %>%
  mutate(across(
    where(is.character),
    ~ str_replace(., trailing_comma_regex, "")
  )) %>%
  filter(if_any(-FormID, ~ . != ""))
  
max_subjects <- 
  subject$SubjectArrested %>% 
  map_int(str_count, ",") %>% 
  max() + 1


subject <- subject %>% 
  separate(SubjectArrested, 
           paste0("arrested__", 1:max_subjects), 
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  separate(SubjectType, 
           paste0("type__", 1:max_subjects), 
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  separate(SubjectAge, 
           paste0("age__", 1:max_subjects), 
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  separate(SubjectRaceEthnicity, 
           paste0("race__", 1:max_subjects), 
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  separate(SubjectGender, 
           paste0("gender__", 1:max_subjects), 
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  separate(SubjectInjuredInIncident, 
           paste0("injured__", 1:max_subjects),
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  separate(SubjectInjuredPriorToIncident, 
           paste0("injured_prior__", 1:max_subjects),
           ",",
           fill="right") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -FormID,
               names_to="column",
               values_to="value",
               values_drop_na=TRUE) %>%
  separate(column, c("column", "index"), "__") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="column", values_from="value") %>%
  rename(form_id=FormID)

```

Now we will clean up this table, column by column.

#### `index` and `arrested`

`index` is the index into the subject list. It should be an integer. `arrested` is a boolean.

```{r}
subject <- subject %>% 
  mutate(index=as.integer(index),
         arrested=as.logical(arrested)
  )

```

#### `type` and `gender`

We will convert these to factors.

```{r}
subject <- subject %>% 
  mutate(type=factor(type, levels=subject_type_levels),
         gender=factor(gender, levels=gender_levels))
```

#### `age`

This field is not currently strictly numeric -- it also contains values `"Unknown"` and `"Juvenile"`. We will add a boolean column, `juvenile` and convert `age` to an integer. The value of `"Unknown"` will map to `NA` in both columns.

```{r}
as_integer_or_na <- function(x) suppressWarnings(as.integer(x))
subject <- subject %>% 
  mutate(juvenile=case_when(
    age=="Juvenile" ~ TRUE,
    !is.na(as_integer_or_na(age)) ~ FALSE
  )) %>%
  mutate(age=as_integer_or_na(age))
```

#### `race`

We need to normalize some names before converting to a factor.

```{r}
subject <- subject %>%
  mutate(
    race = case_when(
      race == "Black or African American" ~ "Black",
      race == "Am. Indian"                ~ "American Indian",
      TRUE                                ~ race
    ),
    race=factor(race, levels=race_levels)
  )
```
### `injured`
We expect only "Yes", "No", "Unknown" and "".  We will convert this to a boolean (or `NA`)

```{r}
subject <- subject %>% mutate(injured = str_trim(injured),
                   injured_prior = str_trim(injured_prior))
stopifnot(
  0 == 
    subject %>% 
    filter(!(injured %in% c("Yes", "No", "Unknown", "", NA))) %>% 
    nrow()
  ,
  0 == 
    subject %>%
    filter(!(injured_prior %in% c("Yes", "No", "Unknown", "", NA))) %>% 
    nrow()
) 
subject <- subject %>% mutate(
  injured = case_when(
    injured == "Yes" ~ TRUE,
    injured == "No" ~ FALSE,
    TRUE ~ NA
  ),
  injured_prior = case_when(
    injured_prior == "Yes" ~ TRUE,
    injured_prior == "No" ~ FALSE,
    TRUE ~ NA
  )
)
```


#### Cleanup and finish

Finally, we reorder the columns.

```{r}
subject <- subject %>% 
  select(form_id, index, arrested, type, age, juvenile, race, gender, injured, injured_prior)
```

```{r purl=FALSE}
subject
```

## Incident set membership tables

These tables are built from columns that contain value-lists with the following properties:

1.  For each column, the set of values is drawn from a finite list
2.  For each field, there are no repeated values.
3.  The order of the list elements does not matter.

For each of these columns, we will create a new table with one row per value, using this function:

```{r}
### table should have two columns: FormID and list_col
make_set_membership_table <- function(table, levels, separating_regex = ",") {
  table <- table %>%
    mutate(list_col = str_replace(list_col, trailing_comma_regex, "")) %>%
    filter(list_col != "")

  max_values <- table$list_col %>%
    map_int(str_count, separating_regex) %>%
    max() + 1

  table %>%
    separate(list_col,
             paste0("list_col__", 1:max_values),
             separating_regex,
             fill="right"
    ) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols=-FormID,
                 names_to="column",
                 values_to="value",
                 values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(value=factor(str_trim(value), levels=levels)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(value)) %>%
    rename(form_id=FormID) %>%
    select(form_id, value)
}
```

### `incident_weather`

```{r}
incident_weather <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=IncidentWeather) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(weather_levels, 
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(weather=value)
```

### `incident_video_type`

```{r}
incident_video_type <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=VideoType) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(video_type_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(video_type=value)
```

### `incident_lighting`

```{r}
incident_lighting <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=IncidentLighting) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(lighting_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(lighting=value)
```

### `incident_location_type`

```{r}
incident_location_type <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=LocationType) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(location_type_levels, 
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(location_type=value)
```

### `incident_type`

```{r}
incident_type <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID, list_col=IncidentType) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(incident_type_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(type=value)

```

### `incident_contact_origin`

```{r}
incident_contact_origin <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID, list_col=ContactOrigin) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(contact_origin_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(contact_origin=value)
```

### `incident_planned_contact`

```{r}
incident_planned_contact <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID, list_col=PlannedContact) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(planned_contact_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(planned_contact=value)
```

### `incident_officer_injury_type`

This is pulled from the field `OfficerInjuryType`, which is of mixed type. The field may be equal to `"No Injury"` `"Not Injured"`, or to `"Not Provided"`. Otherwise, it is value-list column, using the levels below. When it is a value-list column, we will use it to populate the `incident_officer_injury_type` table. The other values will be reflected in the `incident` table.

```{r}

incident_officer_injury_type <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID, list_col=OfficerInjuryType) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(officer_injury_type_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(officer_injury_type=value)
```

### `incident_officer_medical_treatment`

```{r}
incident_officer_medical_treatment <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID, list_col=OfficerMedicalTreatment) %>%
  make_set_membership_table(officer_medical_treatment_levels,
                            sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(officer_medical_treatment=value)
```

## Messy relationship tables

These tables are built from columns that contain value-lists that are "messy" in the following sense. Each column contains value-lists with repeated values -- because the values apply to individual subjects -- but there is no reliable way to assign individual list elements to individual subjects. For example, `FormID` `20221` has two subjects, but field `SubjectActions` has three values:

```{r purl=FALSE}
uof_raw %>% 
  filter(FormID==20221) %>%
  mutate(SubjectActions=str_replace(SubjectActions, ",?$", "")) %>%
  select(FormID, SubjectType, SubjectActions) %>%
  separate(SubjectActions, into=paste0("SubjectActions_", 1:3), ",") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

The value `"Resisted arrest/police officer control"` appears twice because it applies to both subjects. But `"Prevent harm to another"` appears only once, and it not clear if it applies to the first subject or to the second one.

We will create a separate table for each of these columns, assigning all of the values -- including the repeated values -- to the incident. There will also be an index column, so that the list position can be reconstructed if necessary.

```{r}
make_messy_relationship_table <- function(table, levels, separating_regex) {
  table <- table %>%
    mutate(list_col = str_replace(list_col, trailing_comma_regex, "")) %>%
    filter(list_col != "")

  max_values <- table$list_col %>%
    map_int(str_count, separating_regex) %>%
    max() + 1

  table %>%
    separate(list_col,
             paste0("value__", 1:max_values),
             separating_regex,
             fill="right"
    ) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -FormID,
                 names_to="column",
                 values_to="value",
                 values_drop_na=TRUE) %>%
    separate(column, c("column", "index"), "__") %>%
    mutate(index=as.integer(index)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from="column", values_from="value") %>%
    mutate(value=factor(str_trim(value), levels=levels)) %>%
    rename(form_id=FormID) %>%
    filter(!is.na(value))
}
```

### `incident_subject_perceived_condition`

```{r}
incident_subject_perceived_condition <- uof_raw %>%
  select(FormID, list_col=PerceivedConditionOfSubject) %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(perceived_condition_levels,
                                sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(perceived_condition=value)
```

### `incident_subject_action`

```{r}

incident_subject_action <- uof_raw_trimmed %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=SubjectActions) %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(subject_action_levels,
                                sep_comma_optional_space) %>%
  rename(subject_action=value)
```

### `incident_subject_resistance`

```{r}
incident_subject_resistance <- uof_raw_trimmed %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=SubjectResistance) %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(subject_resistance_levels,
                                sep_comma_optional_space) %>%
  rename(subject_resistance=value)
```

### `incident_subject_medical_treatment`

```{r}
incident_subject_medical_treatment <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=SubjectMedicalTreatment) %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(subject_medical_treatment_levels,
                                sep_comma_optional_space) %>%
  rename(subject_medical_treatment=value)
```

### `incident_subject_injury`

```{r}
incident_subject_injury <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=SubjectInjuryType) %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(subject_injury_levels,
                                sep_comma_optional_space) %>%
  rename(subject_injury=value)
```

### `incident_subject_force_type`

```{r}
incident_subject_force_type <- uof_raw %>% 
  select(FormID, list_col=ForceType) %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(force_type_levels,
                                sep_comma_space_no_paren) %>%
  rename(force_type=value)
```

### `incident_subject_reason_not_arrested`

Two values in this field needs to be normalized: We will replace
`"NoProbableCause-SubjectNotInvolved"` with `"No Probable Cause- Subject Not Involved"`
and 


```{r}
incident_subject_reason_not_arrested <- uof_raw %>%
  mutate(ReasonSubjectNotArrested = str_replace_all(
    ReasonSubjectNotArrested,
    "NoProbableCause-SubjectNotInvolved",
    "No Probable Cause- Subject Not Involved"
  )) %>%
  mutate(ReasonSubjectNotArrested = str_replace_all(
    ReasonSubjectNotArrested,
    "Insufficient Probable Cause-includes continuing investigation",
    "Insufficient Probable Cause- includes continuing investigation"
  )) %>%
  select(FormID, list_col="ReasonSubjectNotArrested") %>%
  make_messy_relationship_table(reason_not_arrested_levels,
                                sep_comma_optional_space) %>%
  rename(reason_not_arrested=value)
```

## `incident` table

### Set up

First, we select the columns we will need from the raw data.

```{r}
incident <- uof_raw %>%
  select(
    form_id = FormID,
    agency_county = County,
    agency_name = AgencyName,
    officer_name = OfficerName,
    officer_name_id = UserID,
    report_number = ReportNumber,
    incident_case_number = IncidentCaseNumber,
    incident_date_1 = IncidentDate,
    incident_municipality = IncidentMunicipality,
    other_officer_involved = OtherOfficerInvolved,
    officer_in_uniform = OfficerInUniform,
    indoor_or_outdoor = IndoorOrOutdoor,
    video_footage = VideoFootage,
    officer_age = OfficerAge,
    officer_race = OfficerRaceEthnicity,
    officer_rank = OfficerRank,
    officer_gender = OfficerGender,
    officer_injured = OfficerInjuriesInjured,
    subject_injured_count = TotalSubInjuredInIncident
  )
```

### Fields not selected

Before we clean up these fields, let us review the fields we are omitting.

#### `IncidentID` 

This is a synthetic field composed of other fields, so we do not need it.

```{r}
stopifnot(
  0 ==
    uof_raw %>%
    filter(
      IncidentID !=
        str_to_upper(glue::glue("{County}-{AgencyName}-{IncidentCaseNumber}"))
    ) %>%
    filter(
      IncidentID !=
        str_to_upper(glue::glue("{County}-{AgencyName}- {IncidentCaseNumber}"))
    ) %>%
    filter(
      IncidentID !=
        str_to_upper(glue::glue("{County}-{AgencyName}-\t{IncidentCaseNumber}"))
    ) %>%
    filter(
      IncidentID !=
        str_to_upper(glue::glue("{County}-{AgencyName}-  {IncidentCaseNumber}"))
    ) %>%
    nrow()
)
```




#### `incident_weather`, `video_type`, `incident_lighting`, `location_type`, `incident_type`, `contact_origin`, `planned_contact`, `OfficerMedicalTreatment`, `PerceivedConditionOfSubject`,`SubjectActions`,`SubjectResistance`, `SubjectMedicalTreatment`, `SubjectInjuryType`, `ForceType`, and `ReasonSubjectNotArrested`

These fields are handled in other tables.

#### `OfficerInjuryType`

We did not capture the `"Not injured"` or empty-string value in the `incident_officer_injury_type` table, but that value is largely redundant with `OfficerInjuriesInjured` which is `"True"` precisely when `OfficerInjuryType`is `"Not Injured"` or the empty string, except in 8 rows, which are evidently miscoded.

```{r}
stopifnot(
  8 == uof_raw %>%
    select(OfficerInjuryType, OfficerInjuriesInjured) %>%
    mutate(NoInjury = str_detect(OfficerInjuryType, "Not injured") |
           OfficerInjuryType == "") %>%
    filter(NoInjury == (OfficerInjuriesInjured == "True")) %>%
    nrow()
)
```

#### `SubjectArrested`, `SubjectType`, `SubjectAge`, `SubjectRaceEthnicity`, `SubjectsGender`, `SubjectInjuredInIncident`, `SubjectInjuredPriorToIncident`

These fields are reflected in the `subject` table.

#### `IncidentYear`

`IncidentYear` is redundant with `IncidentDate`.

```{r}
stopifnot(
  all(
    uof_raw$IncidentYear == lubridate::year(uof_raw$IncidentDate)
  )
)
```

### `incident` fields

#### `agency_county`

Switch to using the census county names. In particular, the non-counties `"NJSP"` and `"Other"` will be mapped to `NA`.

```{r}
incident <- incident %>% 
  mutate(agency_county=paste0(agency_county, " County")) %>%
  mutate(agency_county = factor(agency_county, county_levels))
```

#### `agency_name`
There are over 400 distinct values in this field, at least 19 of which appear exactly once, so we will not use a factor here.

In order to reconcile the agency names in this dataset with the agency
names in the NJ OAG Law Enforcement Officer Diversity dataset, we will make some modifications.
```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  mutate(
    agency_name = case_when(
      agency_name == "Burlington County Sheriffs Office" ~ "Burlington Co Sheriffs Office",
      agency_name == "Mercer Co Prosecutor Off" ~ "Mercer Co Prosecutors Office",
      agency_name == "Hudson Co ProsecutorOff-S/Force" ~ "Hudson Co Prosecutors Office",
      agency_name == "Somerset Co Sheriffs Dept" ~ "Somerset Co Sheriffs Office",
      agency_name == "Middle Twsp PD" ~ "Middle Twp PD",
      agency_name == "State Police" ~ "New Jersey State Police",
      agency_name == "Rutgers Univ Police" ~ "Rutgers University PD",
      agency_name == "Division Of Fish And Wildlife" ~ "NJ Division Of Fish And Wildlife",
      agency_name == "NJ State Human Services Police" ~ "NJ Department Of Human Services",
      agency_name == "Division of Criminal Justice" ~ "NJ Division of Criminal Justice",
      agency_name == "Park Police" ~ "New Jersey State Park Police",
      agency_name == "Toms River Township" ~ "Toms River Twp PD",
      agency_name == "Hardyston Twp Police Dept" ~ "Hardyston Twp PD",
      agency_name == "Linden Police Department" ~ "Linden PD",
      TRUE ~ agency_name
    )
  )
```


#### `officer_name` and `officer_name_id`

The `officer_name` associated to a single `officer_name_id` is not always consistent in spelling and capitalization. For example:

```{r purl=FALSE}
incident %>% 
  group_by(officer_name_id) %>% 
  summarise(distinct_names=n_distinct(officer_name)) %>%
  filter(distinct_names>1) %>%
  left_join(select(incident, officer_name, officer_name_id), 
            by="officer_name_id") %>%
  unique()
```

Therefore, we will choose the most common variant for each name id and apply that to all rows. We will save variant names in a new table, `officer_name_variants`.

```{r}
incident <- incident %>% 
  mutate(officer_name = na_if(officer_name, ""))

standard_names <- incident %>% 
  count(officer_name, officer_name_id) %>%
  group_by(officer_name_id) %>%
  slice(which.max(n)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(officer_name_id, officer_name)

officer_name_variants <- incident %>%
  select(officer_name_id, officer_name) %>%
  unique()

incident <- incident %>% 
  select(-officer_name) %>%
  left_join(standard_names, by="officer_name_id") 

rm(standard_names)
```

#### `report_number`, `incident_case_number`, and `incident_date_1`

We leave these fields as they are.

#### `incident_municipality`
This field is of 
the form `<municipality>, <county-name>`. We will break this field up into `incident_municipality` and `incident_municipality_county`.

```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  separate(
    incident_municipality,
    c("incident_municipality", "incident_municipality_county"),
    sep = ",",
    fill = "right"
  ) %>%
  mutate(incident_municipality_county =
           str_trim(incident_municipality_county))
```

Next, we will build a lookup table, matching the unique municipality/county
values in the UOF dataset to the census municipality names.  This is done in
three steps.  
```{r}
unique_municipalities <- incident %>%
  select(incident_municipality_county, incident_municipality) %>%
  unique()
```

First step:  Exact matches:
```{r}
lookup_1 <- unique_municipalities %>%
  inner_join(census_municipalities,
             by=c("incident_municipality"="municipality_and_type",
                  "incident_municipality_county"="county")) %>%
  mutate(census_municipality=incident_municipality) %>%
  select(incident_municipality, incident_municipality_county, census_municipality)
```
Second step: Matches with the base name (excluding the municipality "type", such as "borough" or "township"):
```{r}
lookup_2 <- unique_municipalities %>%
  anti_join(lookup_1,
            by=c("incident_municipality", "incident_municipality_county")) %>%
  inner_join(census_municipalities,
             by=c("incident_municipality"="municipality",
                  "incident_municipality_county"="county")) %>%
  mutate(census_municipality=municipality_and_type) %>%
  select(incident_municipality, incident_municipality_county, census_municipality)
```
Third step:  The remaining municipalities require ad-hoc logic.
```{r}
lookup_3 <- unique_municipalities %>%
  anti_join(
    lookup_1,
    by = c("incident_municipality", "incident_municipality_county")
  ) %>%
  anti_join(
    lookup_2,
    by = c("incident_municipality", "incident_municipality_county")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    census_municipality = case_when(
      # Name changes:  Dover, Ocean County -->           Toms River
      #                Washington, Mercer County -->     Robbinsville
      #                West Paterson, Essex County -->   Woodland Park
      #                South Belmar, Monmouth County --> Spring Lake
      incident_municipality_county == "Ocean County" &
        incident_municipality == "Dover" ~ "Toms River township",
      incident_municipality_county == "Mercer County" &
        incident_municipality == "Washington" ~ "Robbinsville township",
      incident_municipality_county == "Passaic County" &
        incident_municipality == "West Paterson" ~ "Woodland Park borough",
      incident_municipality_county == "Monmouth County" &
        incident_municipality == "South Belmar" ~ "Spring Lake borough",
      # "Princeton township" and "Princeton borough" merged to form just-plain
      # "Princeton" -- the only municipality in NJ without a type!
      incident_municipality_county == "Mercer County" &
        incident_municipality == "Princeton township" ~ "Princeton",
      # Cleanup miscellaneous idiosyncrasies.
      incident_municipality_county == "Essex County" &
        incident_municipality == "Village of South Orange" ~ "South Orange Village township",
      incident_municipality_county == "Essex County" &
        incident_municipality == "Caldwell Borough" ~ "Caldwell borough",
      incident_municipality_county == "Monmouth County" &
        incident_municipality == "Spring Lake Boro" ~ "Spring Lake borough",
      incident_municipality_county == "Somerset County" &
        incident_municipality == "Peapack & Gladstone" ~ "Peapack and Gladstone borough"
    )
  )
```

Now build the full lookup table:
```{r}
lookup <- rbind(lookup_1, lookup_2, lookup_3)
```
Check that we have no duplicates, and that the only municipality we are mapping
to `NA` is `"Other"`:
```{r}
stopifnot(0 ==
  lookup %>% count(incident_municipality, incident_municipality_county) %>%
    filter(n>1) %>% nrow()
)
stopifnot("Other" == 
            lookup %>% filter(is.na(census_municipality)) %>% pull(incident_municipality)
)
```

Now, finally, we can use the lookup table to tidy the `incident_municipality field`:
```{r}
incident <- incident %>% 
  left_join(lookup, 
            by = c("incident_municipality", "incident_municipality_county")) %>% 
  mutate(incident_municipality=census_municipality) %>%
  select(-census_municipality) 
```

Let's also use the county levels for `incident_municipality_county`:
```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  mutate(incident_municipality_county =
         factor(incident_municipality_county, county_levels))
```
#### `other_officer_involved` and `officer_in_uniform`
These fields are booleans. 
```{r}
incident <- incident %>% mutate(
  other_officer_involved = as.logical(other_officer_involved),
  officer_in_uniform = as.logical(officer_in_uniform)
)
```

#### `indoor_or_outdoor`

This field could indicate one or the other, or both, though the order is not consistent:

```{r purl=FALSE}
incident %>% count(indoor_or_outdoor)
```

We will break this into a pair of booleans.

```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  mutate(
    indoors = str_detect(indoor_or_outdoor, "Indoors"),
    outdoors = str_detect(indoor_or_outdoor, "Outdoors")
  ) %>%
  select(-indoor_or_outdoor)
```

#### `video_footage`.

We will correct the spelling of `"Unknown"` before using a factor.

```{r}
video_footage_levels <- c("Yes", "No", "Unknown")
incident <- incident %>%
  mutate(video_footage=str_replace(video_footage, "Unknow", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(video_footage=factor(video_footage, levels=video_footage_levels))
```

#### `officer_age`
This column requires some cleanup. We also remove implausible ages.

```{r}
incident <- incident |> 
  mutate(officer_age = str_remove(officer_age, regex("\\s*years\\s*old", ignore_case=TRUE))) |>
  mutate(officer_age = str_remove_all(officer_age, "/|`")) |>
  mutate(officer_age = str_replace(officer_age, regex("twenty-nine", ignore_case=TRUE), "29")) |>
  mutate(officer_age = str_replace(officer_age, regex("twenty four", ignore_case=TRUE), "24"))

# After this cleanup, we expect only three exceptions
exceptions <- c("NA", "3.5", "NEWARK POLICE VEST")
stopifnot(
  exceptions == incident |> filter(!str_detect(officer_age, "^\\d+$")) |> pull(officer_age) |> unique()
)

# Convert to integer and remove implausible ages
incident <- incident |> 
  mutate(officer_age = parse_integer(officer_age, na=exceptions)) |>
  mutate(officer_age = ifelse(between(officer_age, 18, 67), officer_age, NA))
```

#### `officer_race` and `officer_gender`

We perform the same transformations as we did on the `subject` `race` and `gender` columns.

```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  mutate(
    officer_race = case_when(
      officer_race == "Black or African American" ~ "Black",
      officer_race == "Am. Indian"                ~ "American Indian",
      TRUE                                        ~ officer_race
    ),
    officer_race = factor(officer_race, levels = race_levels)
  )

incident <- incident %>% 
  mutate(officer_gender=factor(officer_gender, levels=gender_levels))

```

#### `officer_rank`

This field appears to be free text, and there are a lot of variations. We leave the column unchanged.

#### `officer_injured`

We will convert this to a boolean.

```{r}
incident <- incident %>% 
  mutate(officer_injured = (officer_injured=="1"))
```

#### `subject_injured_count`

We leave this field unchanged.

### Clean up and finish

#### Add a `subject_count` column

```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  left_join(count(subject, form_id, name = "subject_count"),
            by = "form_id")
```

#### Order the columns

```{r}
incident <- incident %>%
  relocate(
    form_id,
    report_number,
    incident_case_number,
    incident_date_1,
    agency_county,
    agency_name,
    incident_municipality,
    incident_municipality_county,
    officer_name_id,
    officer_name,
    officer_age,
    officer_race,
    officer_rank,
    officer_gender,
    officer_injured,
    video_footage,
    indoors,
    outdoors,
    subject_count,
    subject_injured_count
  )
```

```{r purl=FALSE}
incident
```
