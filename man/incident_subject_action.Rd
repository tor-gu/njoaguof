\details{
This data is extracted from the \code{SubActions} field in
\code{use_of_force_raw}.

There may be multiple rows in this table linking to a single incident or
a single subject.

When an incident is associated to more than one subject, there is no reliable
way of associating rows in this table to individual subjects. The source
field is a comma separated list, and the \code{index} column in this
table indicates the position in the list (1 = first position).
