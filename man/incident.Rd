\title{Incidents in the NJ OAG Use of Force database}
\format{
A dataframe with 23 columns
\describe{
\item{form_id}{A unique identifier for the row, present in the source data}

\item{report_number}{An identifier for a use of force report (potentially
containing multiple incidents)}

\item{incident_case_number}{A unique internal agency case number assigned
to the incident.}

\item{incident_date_1}{The date of the incident. In the source data, this
is column \code{IncidentDate1}, and is the date the OAG dashboard uses as the
incident date.}

\item{agency_county}{The county of the \emph{agency}.
Note that this is not the incident location. This is column
\code{County2}.}

\item{agency_name}{The name of the agency, e.g. "Essex Co Sheriffs
Office".}

\item{incident_municipality}{The municipality where the incident occurred.}

\item{incident_municipality_county}{The county where the incident
occurred.}

\item{officer_name_id}{An ID identifying the officer. In the source data,
this is column \code{officer_name}. }

\item{officer_name}{The most common name associated to the
\code{officer_name_id}. In this table, each
\code{officer_name_id} is associated to a single name, while in the
source data, names will sometimes vary in spelling and capitalization.

For name variants, refer to table \code{officer_name_variants}. To associate
a name variant to a specific incident, refer to the raw data
\code{use_of_force_raw}, column \code{Officer_Name2}.}

\item{officer_age}{The officer's age.}

\item{officer_race}{The officer's race.}

\item{officer_rank}{The officer's rank.}

\item{officer_gender}{The officer's gender.}

\item{officer_injured}{\code{TRUE} if the officer was injured in the
incident. \emph{C.f.} tables \code{incident_officer_injury_type} and
\code{incident_officer_medical_treatment}.}

\item{video_footage}{\code{TRUE} if there is video footage of the
incident. \emph{C.f} table \code{incident_video_type}.}

\item{indoors}{\code{TRUE} if the incident was indoors. Not exclusive of
\code{outdoors}.}

\item{outdoors}{\code{TRUE} if the incident was indoors. Not exclusive of
\code{indoors}.}

\item{subject_count}{Number of subjects involved. This will reliably match
the number of subject in the \code{subject} table with same \code{form_id}.}

\item{subject_injured_count}{Number of injured subjects. This field
corresponds to column \code{TotalSubInjuredIncident} in the raw data.

\emph{\strong{Warning} This field is not reliable. There over 700
incidents with \code{subject_injured_count > subject_count} and over
3500 rows with \code{subject_injured_count == 0} that have matching rows
in \code{incident_subject_injury} indicating specific injury types.}}
